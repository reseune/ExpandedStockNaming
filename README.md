# ExpandedStockNaming

This simple patch adds the stock naming configuration (explained here: https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/developerarticles.html/whats-in-a-vessel-name-r206/) to all parts that can decouple, which includes decouplers (obviously), separaters, and some heat shields. It should work with non-stock parts. This allows you to use the stock naming system--with priority--even for lifters and the like that don't have command modules.

Note that the priority system for naming only works in the VAB / SPH. If you want to use this capability in flight mode, change this setting in settings.cfg to be true then the configure vessel naming option will show for parts configured when in flight mode 
SHOW_VESSEL_NAMING_IN_FLIGHT = True

Thank you @linuxgurugamer for PDPN, which gave me the idea to do this for myself, and all of the amazing modders in the community that made me share even a simple mod like this for anyone to use.
